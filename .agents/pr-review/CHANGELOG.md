## Threads

| # | Source | File:Line | Reviewer | Substance | Verdict | Why |
|---|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|-----|
| T1 | fork#17 | packages/prepare-for-release/src/executors/publish-placeholder/executor.ts:75 | gemini-code-assist | Spreading `...original` into placeholder package.json risks running lifecycle scripts (`prepare`/`prepack`/`prepublishOnly`) from the original package during `npm pack` — placeholder dir has no source, so scripts fail and executor crashes. | fix | Real crash risk; replace spread with explicit minimal metadata. |
| T2 | fork#17 | packages/prepare-for-release/src/executors/publish-placeholder/executor.ts:133 | amazon-q-developer | `trustCommandFor` hardcodes `ThePlenkov/nx.ts` — granting trust to wrong repo if plugin is consumed elsewhere. | fix | Plugin is intended to be published; repo path should be a runtime input (env / option) with safe default. |
| T3 | fork#17 | packages/prepare-for-release/src/executors/publish-placeholder/executor.ts:42 (and 69–106) | sonarqubecloud (new_security_rating=3) | Resource leak / unsafe pattern around `mkdtemp` + `npm pack` + `spawnSync` — temp dir not cleaned up on pack failure. | fix | SonarCloud gate fails on this; add try/finally to guarantee tempdir cleanup. |
| T4 | fork#17 | packages/prepare-for-release/src/executors/publish-placeholder/executor.ts:160 | amazon-q-developer | `JSON.parse(readFileSync(...))` is in a try/catch that silently continues, but the catch wraps both. Risk: uncaught throws for unreadable file. | fix | Narrow catch; log + continue for JSON parse errors, rethrow on FS error so executor fails loudly (or catch both but emit a warn). |
| T5 | fork#17 | packages/prepare-for-release/src/executors/publish-placeholder/executor.ts:157 | gemini-code-assist | `.replace(/\/package\.json$/, '')` is not cross-platform safe (Windows backslashes). | fix | Use `dirname()` from `node:path`. |
| T6 | fork#17 | packages/prepare-for-release/src/executors/publish-placeholder/executor.ts:2–7 / 37–40 | gemini-code-assist | `import which from 'which'` then `which.sync(...)` may throw `TypeError` in ESM. Use `import { sync as whichSync } from 'which'`. | fix | Cheap, ESM-safe, single-line change. |
| T7 | fork#17 | packages/prepare-for-release/src/generators/init/generator.ts:2,26,42 | gemini-code-assist | `join` from `node:path` produces OS-dependent separators. Nx `Tree` API requires POSIX. Use `joinPathFragments` from `@nx/devkit`. | fix | Correct on all 3 sites; Nx convention. |
| T8 | fork#17 | packages/prepare-for-release/src/plugin.ts:2,25,46 | gemini-code-assist | `join` + regex `.replace(/\/project\.json$/, '')` for project paths; `isAbsolute` not checked. Use `dirname` + `isAbsolute` from `node:path`. | fix | Real cross-platform + absolute-path bug. |
| T9 | fork#17 | .github/workflows/release.yml:62 | amazon-q-developer | OIDC publish with `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE: 'true'` but no `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` and no `setup-node` `registry-url` on the publish step → publish will fail. | fix | Wire `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` (OIDC-issued) via `actions/setup-node` `registry-url` (already set on the install step but not propagated). Move `setup-node` above `nx release publish` or set env explicitly. |
| T10 | fork#17 | .github/workflows/release.yml:75 | amazon-q-developer | Cross-repo `gh pr create` to `nx-devkit/nx.ts` uses default `GITHUB_TOKEN` → permission denied. | reply | Correct in principle, but for THIS PR (syncing back to upstream) the workflow runs in `ThePlenkov/nx.ts` and the GHA `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot cross repos. The fix needs `UPSTREAM_GITHUB_TOKEN` PAT — that's a secret the maintainer must add in repo settings. We can wire the env var; the secret itself is out of scope. Wire `GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.UPSTREAM_GITHUB_TOKEN }}` with fallback comment. |
| T11 | issue-comment | .github/workflows/release.yml:62 (Sonar) | sonarqubecloud | Quality Gate failed: new_security_rating = 3 (required ≤ 1). | fix | Resolved by fixing T3 (and T1 — spreading package.json is the proximate cause of the new_code security rating drop per the dashboard). |
| T12 | issue-comment | (PR conversation) | coderabbitai | Skipped (draft PR). | reply | No action — draft skipped by config. |
| T13 | fork#17 (CodeRabbit review skipped — Draft) | — | coderabbitai | No content. | reply | n/a — skipped. |

## CI

| Check | State | Decision |
|-------|-------|----------|
| SonarCloud Code Analysis (fork#17) | FAIL | fix — new_security_rating=3; see T1, T3 |
| Amazon Q Developer | pass | none |
| CodeRabbit | pass (skipped — draft) | none |
| Upstream #4 (nx-devkit/nx.ts) | n/a | no checks configured yet — fork PR is the canonical signal source |

## Plan (in order)

1. Fix T1 + T3 + T4 + T5 + T6: rewrite `executor.ts` to use minimal placeholder metadata, `dirname` for path, `whichSync` import, try/finally tempdir cleanup, narrower catch + warn on JSON parse failure.
2. Fix T2: make `trustCommandFor` accept a repo path (env or option) with safe default; pass through from `nx.json` plugin options and from `init` generator context.
3. Fix T7: switch `init/generator.ts` to `joinPathFragments` from `@nx/devkit`.
4. Fix T8: switch `plugin.ts` to `dirname`/`isAbsolute` from `node:path`.
5. Fix T9 + T10: update `release.yml` to set `registry-url` on the install step (already there) and document `UPSTREAM_GITHUB_TOKEN` for cross-repo PR.
6. Run `bun install`, `bun run lint`, `bun test`, `bun run build`.
7. Commit, push, then reply in threads + resolve fixed ones.

## Changelog (append as you go)

- (pending) fix(security): minimal placeholder package.json, try/finally tempdir, ESM-safe `whichSync` import, `dirname` cross-platform paths, `trustRepo` option with allowlist validation
- (pending) fix(workflow): document `UPSTREAM_GITHUB_TOKEN` for cross-repo PR + OIDC publish prerequisites
- (pending) docs(agents): REVIEW.md ledger

## Resolutions (post-implementation)

- T1, T3, T4, T5, T6: rewrote `executor.ts` — minimal placeholder metadata, try/catch tempdir cleanup, ESM-safe `whichSync`, `dirname` for paths, narrower catch (SyntaxError vs FS).
- T2: added `trustRepo` option (allowlist `owner/repo` regex) + `NPM_TRUST_REPO` env fallback, default `ThePlenkov/nx.ts`.
- T7: `init/generator.ts` switched to `joinPathFragments` from `@nx/devkit` (3 sites).
- T8: `plugin.ts` switched to `dirname` + `isAbsolute`; workspace-root skip covers `''`, `'.'`, and absolute `workspaceRoot`.
- T9: documented OIDC prerequisites in `release.yml` (npm >= 11.5, `registry-url`, `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE`, `id-token: write`).
- T10: `release.yml` now reads `UPSTREAM_GITHUB_TOKEN` with `GITHUB_TOKEN` fallback; documented that the secret must be provisioned in repo settings.
- T11, T12, T13: addressed transitively.

Tests: 11/11 pass in `@nx-devkit/prepare-for-release`. `bun run lint` clean for changed files (one pre-existing warning in unrelated file). `bun run build` green. `bash scripts/e2e.sh` green.

| # | Source | File:Line | Reviewer | Substance | Verdict | Why |
|---|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|-----|
| N1 | fork#17 (issue 4770222932) | packages/prepare-for-release/src/executors/publish-placeholder/schema.json | kilo-code-bot (CRITICAL) | `trustRepo` option is defined in `executor.ts:9-27` but missing from `schema.json` (lines 1-35), preventing users from configuring it via `nx.json`. | fix | With `additionalProperties: false`, Nx rejects the option. Added trustRepo property with `owner/repo` regex pattern. |
| N2 | fork#17 (issue 4770289407) | schema.json:34, schema.d.ts:7 | kilo-code-bot (CRITICAL) | `trustRepo` missing from both `schema.json` and `schema.d.ts`. | fix | Same root cause as N1; added to both files. |
| N3 | fork#17 (PRRT_kwDOTA4Etc6LUMOL) | schema.json:34 | cubic-dev-ai (P1, conf=9) | Schema missing `trustRepo` property despite the executor accepting and using it; with `additionalProperties: false`, passing `trustRepo` via nx.json will be rejected. | fix | Consensus with kilo + CodeRabbit. |
| N4 | fork#17 (PRRT_kwDOTA4Etc6LUIRr) | schema.json | coderabbitai (Major) | Same: Missing `trustRepo` property in executor schema. | fix | Duplicate of N3. |
| N5 | fork#17 (PRRT_kwDOTA4Etc6LUIRO) | packages/prepare-for-release/AGENTS.md:33-40 | coderabbitai (Major) | `NxPrepareForReleaseOptions` interface in AGENTS.md is missing `trustRepo`. | fix | Doc-only, cheap. |
| N6 | fork#17 (PRRT_kwDOTA4Etc6LUIRX) | packages/prepare-for-release/README.md:45-53 | coderabbitai (Major) | `NxPrepareForReleaseOptions` interface in README is missing `trustRepo`. | fix | Doc-only, cheap. |
| N7 | fork#17 (PRRT_kwDOTA4Etc6LUISJ) | skills/nx-devkit-prepare-for-release/SKILL.md:50-58 | coderabbitai (Major) | `NxPrepareForReleaseOptions` interface in skill is missing `trustRepo`. | fix | Doc-only, cheap. |
| N8 | fork#17 (PRRT_kwDOTA4Etc6LUIRm) | executor.ts:174-252 | coderabbitai + sonarqubecloud (Major) | `publishPlaceholderExecutor` exceeds cognitive complexity threshold (23 > 15) — Sonar gate failure. | fix | Extracted `processPackage` helper; complexity now well under 15. |
| N9 | fork#17 (PRRT_kwDOTA4Etc6LUIRf) | executor.ts:122,150,239 | coderabbitai (Major) | All three `spawnSync` calls lack timeout configuration. Hung npm op would block CI indefinitely. | fix | Added 120s timeout via `spawnWithTimeout` helper used by all 3 call sites. |
| N10 | fork#17 (PRRT_kwDOTA4Etc6LUMOd) | executor.ts:153 | cubic-dev-ai (P2, conf=8) | `isPublished` treats every `npm view` error as "unpublished". Should distinguish 404 from other errors. | fix | Added 404 detection (`isNotFoundStderr`); other errors now throw. |
| N11 | fork#17 (PRRT_kwDOTA4Etc6LUMOR) | packages/typescript-preset/AGENTS.md:26 | cubic-dev-ai (P2, conf=10) | AGENTS.md documents the interface as `NxTypecheckPluginOptions` but actual source defines `NxDevkitTypescriptOptions`. Agent following guide would get resolution error. | fix | Renamed interface in AGENTS.md to match source. |
| N12 | fork#17 (PRRT_kwDOTA4Etc6LUISB) | plugin.ts:5-10,42-59 | coderabbitai (Major) | `createNodesV2` ignores its `options` parameter entirely. Declared `toolsProject` and `targetName` are not honored. | fix | `createNodesV2` now reads `options.targetName` and `options.toolsProject` and applies them. |
| N13 | fork#17 (PRRT_kwDOTA4Etc6LUMOq) | plugin.ts:42 | cubic-dev-ai (P2, conf=8) | Same: `createNodesV2` callback ignores `_options`. | fix | Duplicate of N12. |
| N14 | fork#17 (PRRT_kwDOTA4Etc6LUIQ_) | .github/workflows/release.yml:59-69 | coderabbitai (Major) | Add pre-publish release gates (`bun run check:spec`, `bash scripts/e2e.sh`) before `nx release publish`. | wontfix | Already addressed in cycle 1 (release.yml:64-65, 70-71). Reviewed current workflow — both gates present between lint and the publish step. No additional change needed. |
| N15 | fork#17 (PRRT_kwDOTA4Etc6LUMOl) | release.yml:63 | cubic-dev-ai (P2, conf=7) | Same: missing `bun run check:spec` and `bash scripts/e2e.sh`. | wontfix | Duplicate of N14. |
| N16 | fork#17 (PRRT_kwDOTA4Etc6LUIQu) | release.yml:16,45,81 | coderabbitai + zizmor (Major) | Add `persist-credentials: false` to all `actions/checkout` steps. | fix | Already addressed in cycle 1. Verified: all 3 checkouts have `persist-credentials: false` set. No additional change needed. |
| N17 | fork#17 (PRRT_kwDOTA4Etc6LUMOi) | release.yml:16,45,81 | cubic-dev-ai (P2, conf=8) | Same: add `persist-credentials: false` to all checkouts. | fix | Duplicate of N16. |

## Resolutions (post-implementation, cycle 2)

- N1/N2/N3/N4: added `trustRepo` to `schema.json` (with `owner/repo` regex pattern) and `schema.d.ts` (with docstring).
- N5/N6/N7: added `trustRepo` to `packages/prepare-for-release/AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and `skills/nx-devkit-prepare-for-release/SKILL.md` Options sections.
- N8: refactored `executor.ts` — extracted `resolveOptions`, `readPackageJsonSafe`, `matchesScope`, `publishOnePackage`, `processPackage`. `publishPlaceholderExecutor` now only orchestrates: resolve options, glob packages, iterate, aggregate. Cognitive complexity well under threshold.
- N9: added `spawnWithTimeout` helper with `NPM_SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT_MS = 120_000`; applied to all 3 `spawnSync` call sites (pack, view, publish).
- N10: extracted `isNotFoundStderr`; `isPublished` now throws on non-404 `npm view` failures (network, auth, etc.) instead of silently treating them as "unpublished".
- N11: renamed `NxTypecheckPluginOptions` → `NxDevkitTypescriptOptions` in `packages/typescript-preset/AGENTS.md` to match `src/plugin.ts`.
- N12/N13: `createNodesV2` now reads `options.targetName` (default `'prepare-for-release'`) and `options.toolsProject` (filters matches by exact project root).
- N14/N15/N16/N17: no change required — all four pre-existing in release.yml (added in commit `ff2b196` / `6777445`).

Tests: 15/15 pass in `@nx-devkit/prepare-for-release` (2 new for isPublished 404-vs-error split). 72/72 pass across all 5 plugin packages. `bun run lint` clean (1 pre-existing warning in `scripts/spec-check.ts:101`). `bun run build` green. `bash scripts/e2e.sh` green. `bun run check:spec` green.
