/**
 * Migration: replace nx:run-commands with @nx-devkit/typescript:build
 * for any project that has a build (or build:watch) target using
 * run-commands with tsdown.
 *
 * Walks all projects in the workspace, finds build targets using
 * `nx:run-commands` with tsdown commands, and replaces them with the
 * custom `@nx-devkit/typescript:build` executor.
 *
 * Only migrates commands that match the exact supported forms:
 *   - `tsdown`
 *   - `tsdown --watch`
 *
 * Commands with additional flags or shell composition are skipped to
 * avoid silently dropping behavior. A target is only rewritten when its
 * `cwd` explicitly resolves to the project root — `nx:run-commands`
 * defaults `cwd` to the workspace root, so rewriting an unset/mismatched
 * cwd would silently change which config tsdown loads. Watch targets are
 * marked non-cacheable (`cache: false`) because they never exit.
